&lt;p&gt;I spent most of 2025 disabled from stage II deep infiltarting endometriosis.
Endometriosis is estimated to affect 11%-15% of women aged 15-44. The condition has even been documented in men (fewer than 20 cases, but nonetheless). Widely dismissed as &amp;quot;just a bad period&amp;quot;, it is a scary inflammatory disease that spans far beyond purely gynecological medical scope. Endometriosis is a social issue, too. The stigma surrounding women&#x27;s health, lack of societal awareness, lackluster research, and overall societal expectations that ignore the reality of infradian cycles all contribute to the gaslighting and delays in appropriate care that almost all endometriosis patients experience. 
The average diagnostic delay can be from 7 to 11 years. I didn&#x27;t realize I had endo until I was 29, but from the moment I suspected it, it only took me a 1.5 months to receive a diagnosis via MRI, and only 8 months until I was carted into the operating room while &amp;quot;Mea Culpa&amp;quot; by Engima accompanied my slow fade into anesthesiological bliss.
I am writing this blog post with the hope that it reduces guesswork for somebody else. Whether you suspect you have endometriosis, another hormonal or pelvic issue, or whether you just know some women, work with them, or interact with people at all, learning more about the issue could be the difference between a lifetime of suffering through complications and an early intervention strategy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;slow-collapse-is-something-wrong&quot;&gt;Slow Collapse: Is Something Wrong?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2024, I began to feel somewhat burnt out and lethargic. I attributed this to the stress of studying for EMT exams, but even asking my psychiatrist for beta-blockers didn&#x27;t seem to completely remediate the issue. Even with managed anxiety, I was still slowly, but surely developing some sort of anhedonia. I then had a terribly uncomfortable and painful period, which I ignored because I was trying to be functional, and I didn&#x27;t want to complicate things with my medical training beyond the student accomodations I had already requested for my auditory processing issues that already felt needlessly bureaucratic and complicated. My December period was unremarkable, so I thought all was fine. The ovaries will alternate each menstrual cycle, so I knew that I should just keep an eye out for what happens once my &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; ovary menstruates again. 
I would typically experience premenstrual cramps 1-2 days prior to the first day of my period (when blood appears). In January of 2025, however, I had a lot of (pre-menstrual?) pain in my lower back, which was concerning. After about a week, I finally got my period and sighed with relief that everything is fine, I&#x27;m not dying, it&#x27;s just my period. As time passed, my concerns came back: I didn&#x27;t see much blood the first day, and what I did see was abnormally dark and thick. The second day there was nothing, and only on the third day did it feel like a more normal period. What else was strange – the pain was present the entire time.
My &amp;quot;normal-ish&amp;quot; period ended, but the pain never went away. I was in pain about 80% of the time, easing up during the day. It would come back with intensity towards the evening and keep me from falling asleep, sometimes it would wake me up at night and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fall back asleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was afraid to eat. My appetite completely disappeared and I didn&#x27;t even want to look at fried, sweet, fatty, carb-rich, salty or spicy foods. I could only think about tea, soup and smoothies, but I no longer had any energy to cook myself soup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-are-you-better-now&quot;&gt;So are you better now?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I feel better than I did at the start of 2025? Absolutely. I can sleep through the night with no disturbances from pain. I can eat mostly whatever I&#x27;d like. I rarely have strange sensations in my pelvis, legs, lower back or abdomen now. I am not taking NSAIDs at a rate that is dangerous to my stomach lining. I have put away my heating pad in the shape of a giant diaper and not needed to take it out of the drawer since I&#x27;ve recovered from surgery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still have endometriosis, and I always will. I still have flare days. I have naproxen in my bedside table and purse. My electric blanket is always plugged in, and I often turn on the heated seats when driving in the car. I include pelvic floor exercises in my gym routine. I regularly attend breathwork classes and have been focusing more on somatic modalities for therapeutic release. I say no to a lot of opportunities and invitations. I take a low dose of a GLP medication. I&#x27;m still in the turbulent IUD adjustment phase as I wait for my hormonal cycle to stabilize. And I am still frequenting the doctor&#x27;s office for my BRCA prevention plan and my POTS complaints. I am still learning about the intricacies of my neurodivergence and the relationship it has to my &amp;quot;physical&amp;quot; health. (I&#x27;m not a dualist. You can leave the Descartes at the door.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So am I better? Yes. But I&#x27;m not &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot;, and I never will be, and I don&#x27;t plan to hide that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://asyaplugged.in/know/cyborg-manicure/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;draft&quot;&gt;DRAFT!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto;&quot; src=&quot;stub.png&quot; alt=&quot;This Cyborg Manicure-related article is a stub. You can help Asya by messaging her on Telegram about it.&quot; &gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-cyborg-manicure&quot;&gt;What is a Cyborg Manicure?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyborg manicure is a functional take on nail art that integrates working technology into your nails, enhancing your abilities in some manner. Tiny electronic components like microchips, LEDs, sensors, and magnets are embedded into false nails or attached to the natural nail, transforming your hand into an augmented cyborg appendage. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use your hand as an electronic key, a piece of semi-permanent light-up jewelry, a magnet sensor, digital business card, or even data storage. The result lasts as long as a regular gel manicure – about 4 weeks. Cyborg manicures offer a temporary, non-invasive way to experience &amp;quot;bodyhacking&amp;quot; augmentations, and even to explore certain kinds of creative concepts that are not currently possible with subdermal or even transdermal implants. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;explants-for-everyone&quot;&gt;Explants for Everyone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the formats I work in is a pop-up salon at a conference, festival, nightclub or other type of event. At a pop-up salon, I will offer a range of simple explants on a first-come, first serve basis, one explant per client.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFC chips: Near-Field Communication tags can be programmed by the wearers themselves in an instant, transforming their fingers into digital business cards, art galleries, or wifi password.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFID chips: Radio Frequency Identification tags can store a smaller amount of data, but transport it via a further range to a reading device. Smartphones only have NFC readers, but RFIDs can be used to unlock doors, start vehicles, or log into computers. They need to be programmed using specialized equipment, like a Proxmark or a Flipper.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LED stickers: Light Emitting Diodes are powered by paper-thin NFC antennas when brought into contact with a smartphone&#x27;s NFC reader coil. Some smartphones have stronger coils than others, resulting in a brighter light flash.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnets: Powerful neodymium magnets enable the wearer to sense electromagnetic fields and pick up small metal objects. Great for an enhanced connection with your electronic hardware, magic tricks, and getting stuck to a refrigerator.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These components are attached and sealed with advanced, modern gel manicure techniques onto a prepped nailbed, and last as long as a regular gel manicure: about four weeks. Clients are educated about their explant of choice, the world of bodyhacking, as well as aftercare best practices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own first real bodyhacking experience was at a conference. I got two microchip implants, and the procedure was performed by a person who requested to stay anonymous. I received minimal aftercare instructions and knew little about the implants, and didn&#x27;t even own a proxmark or flipper, and didn&#x27;t get to program then on-site. I am still incredibly happy that I got the implants, but the experience left me feeling like there was a lot of room for improvement. The cyborg manicure is exactly that. It&#x27;s a non-invasive, 30 minute process that involves a personalized educational dialogue about functional augmentation. It&#x27;s safe, fun, and opens up low-stakes avenues for people to experiment with creative ideas, growing the community of bodyhacking cyborgs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creative-cyborg-collaborations&quot;&gt;Creative Cyborg Collaborations&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the short list of explants I provide at my pop-up salons, I have been working on an extended menu of augmentations that can be incorporated into full, ten-finger manicure sets that I offer at my nail studio. My ideal projects involve designing unique functionality for performance artists, musicians, and video shoots. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the possibilities include:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechatronic Motion:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Sculptural elements that spin, flap, or twitch via gesture control or regular real-life physics.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biosensor Pigments:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; UV-reactive photochromic nails that remind you to put on sunscreen, thermochromic polish that reveals designs based on environmental temperature shifts, and a date rape drug-detecting polish that changes color when dipped into a drink spiked with common incapacitating substances.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Fluids:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Using the &amp;quot;aquarium nails&amp;quot; technique, I can encapsulate dyes, small mobile magnets, and even ferrofluid into XL length nail extensions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Displays:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; While there are still some challenges with powering small displays on the nails, I offer custom lenticular print nails that can shift images and display a short .gif type animation on the nails.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m also very interested in projects involving record player needles, breadboard components, small speakers and microphones, and any other electronic components that could be useful to temporarily fashion to a person&#x27;s body for performance art purposes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;discuss-demo&quot;&gt;Discuss &amp;amp; Demo&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always excited to speak about my work and the cultural implications of elective cyborgization. I give talks contextualizing the cyborg manicure within the history of transhumanism, body-hacking, and orthotic devices. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;asya-how-did-you-become-a-manicurist&quot;&gt;Asya, how did you become a manicurist??&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I decided to get my Body Arts Practitioner license, hoping to explore the potential of biosensor tattoo inks. I read a paper called &amp;quot;The Dermal Abyss&amp;quot; and got so excited about the potential of introducing the public to body modification practices via a medical procedure. I also, honestly speaking, was not impressed with the aesthetics that I saw in the tattoo proofs of concept in that paper (or similar research projects on the same topic) and felt like I could offer a contribution to the aesthetic lingua franca of medical tattooing that balances respect for the ritualistic historical background of tattooing as a practice, and the very necessary paradigmatic shifts necessary to shift the medical industry out of it&#x27;s cold, clinical and Foucauldian present into a future where the &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; aspect of &amp;quot;medical care&amp;quot; is felt by all patients.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing the Blood-Borne Pathogens exam was easy, but tackling the issue of safety, efficacy and ultimately functionality of something like biosensing tattoo ink was far from it. While I apprenticed as a tattoo artist, and passionately searched for a PMU &#x2F; medical tattoo apprenticeship or course, I realized that my own bodyhacking practice – my microchip implants – weren&#x27;t all that different from tattoos, which are basically just ink implants. I felt dizzy thinking about all the risks associated with subdermal implantation, especially of smaller (even if encapsulated) particles like ink, and felt the urge to experiment in a safer, temporary, external manner, but without fully getting into the territory of wearables. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s why I pivoted my body modification practice to nails. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;manicures-and-safety&quot;&gt;Manicures and Safety&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While manicures are external to the body, and grow out after four weeks, they still carry certain risks with them, which I am passionate about educating people on just as much as the way the technology I adhere to their nails works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acrylate Monomer&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gel &amp;quot;allergies&amp;quot;, the risk of DIY gel manicures&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPE, glove permeability&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bacterial, blood-borne pathogen risks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disinfection and sterilization of instruments&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UV light risks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dust particles&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry manicure controversy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand soak manicure dangers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up, still in a haze, not wanting to push my head into gear and pack my bags. Disintegration Loops got replaced with techno, I stuffed my suitcase and ran to the Beta Building. Too antsy to order breakfast, I talked with Cory, Rich, (Rachel, Borya,someone new) about Próspera. We are the entertainment, said Cory. He&#x27;s correct. I resisted the idea a bit, responding that perhaps we could, perhaps if anybody cared, I could contribute to this place iterating on a new society with a whole of a lot more good than was currently being planned for. We dragged my luggage to the pier &amp;amp; took about 15 minutes and 4 people to ensure our ferry would actually arrive. TKTKTK&#x27;s drone filmed us travel to Pristine Bay. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
