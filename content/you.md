## About me

<img src="https://asyaplugged.in/assets/ditherpfp.png" alt="Portrait" width="300">

I’m an interface designer & bodyhacker exploring the cybernetic interplay between human and machine. Originally from Moscow, I relocated to California in 2014 and now reside in South Pasadena.

My creative practice revolves around Quantified Self representations, temporary magnet and chip "implant" manicures, and a restrorative yoga practice with a cybernetic, accessibility-minded perspective.

As a counterculture teen blogger in Russia, I was among the earliest voices openly discussing intersectional feminism and LGBTQ+ issues online, inspiring a wave of activism that continues today. Since obtaining a Design Media Arts degree from UCLA, my career has spanned graphic design, web development, teaching programming, and a stint as a motorcycle food courier.

Auxiliary pursuits include pro-bono (legal and medical) interpreting for Russian/Ukrainian immigrants and refugees, prototyping functional jewelry, and producing ambient/hyperpop musical experiments with regional vocalizations.

 Ultimately, I strive to present the human form as a naturalized cyborg - a biological entity already integrated with technology that can be aesthetically and somatically reconfigured to expand personal agency.





## About this website

asyaplugged.in is hosted on Github Pages, and is currently running on the Zola static site generator. I built the front-end myself, albeit relying on some modified snippets from the [Karzok](https://www.getzola.org/themes/karzok/), [zola.386](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/) and [Float](https://www.getzola.org/themes/float/) themes. Huge shout-out to [Konrad Geletey](https://github.com/kogeletey) – this design started with his Karzok theme, which is structured in a way I had a lot of disagreements with, and ultimately ended up teaching me a lot of pivotal lessons about `Tera` and `npm`.

I am hoping to soon implement commenting on my blog via [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). I'd really love to build a similar tool, but based on Telegram post comments instead of GitHub issues. If this sounds like fun to you and you're down to collaborate, drop me a line on Twitter or some other social media that I'm on all the time ;)

You can read more about the conceptual and creative aspects of my site at the [Hello World blog post](https://asyaplugged.in/know/hello-world/).
