## About me

I’m a Russian-American artist & writer based in Pasadena, California. Today, I work as an interface designer. I was born and (mostly) raised in Moscow, moving to California in 2014.

I hold a Design | Media Arts degree from UCLA. I was one of the only two interns at [Are.na](http://www.are.na/). I was "patient zero" of social justice feminism on the Russian web. I taught children how to program at UCode, and am currently at a programming retreat at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

## About this website

asyaplugged.in is hosted on Github Pages, and is currently running on the Zola static site generator. I built the front-end myself, albeit relying on some modified snippets from the [Karzok](https://www.getzola.org/themes/karzok/), [zola.386](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/) and [Float](https://www.getzola.org/themes/float/) themes. Huge shout-out to [Konrad Geletey](https://github.com/kogeletey) – this design started with his Karzok theme, which is structured in a way I had a lot of disagreements with, and ultimately ended up teaching me a lot of pivotal lessons about `Tera` and `npm`.

I am hoping to soon implement commenting on my blog via [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). I'd really love to build a similar tool, but based on Telegram post comments instead of GitHub issues. If this sounds like fun to you and you're down to collaborate, drop me a line on Twitter or some other social media that I'm on all the time ;)

You can read more about the conceptual and creative aspects of my site at the [Hello World blog post](https://asyaplugged.in/know/hello-world/).
