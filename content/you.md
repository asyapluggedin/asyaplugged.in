## About me

<img src="https://asyaplugged.in/assets/ditherpfp.png" alt="Portrait" width="300">

I’m a Russian-American interface designer based in Pasadena, California. I was born and primarily raised in Moscow, and moved to California in 2014.

I hold a Design | Media Arts degree from UCLA. I was one of the only two interns ever at Are.na. I was "patient zero" of social justice feminism on the Russian web. I taught children how to program at UCode, and am currently at a programming retreat at the Recurse Center.
