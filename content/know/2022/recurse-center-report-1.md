This Friday marks the mid-point of my batch at the Recurse Center. I am in a 12 week batch, meaning I have completed 30 out of 60 days of the programming retreat. I already feel like a different person and a better programmer than when I started, and figured that it could be helpful for others to hear about my experience.

Because I intended to do a 12 week retreat from the very start, I will say that I was a little lax with planning my time to be at maximum efficiency. My main goal for the retreat was proving to myself that I enjoy regular programming and learning new things, even if they look very much strange, and feel very much challenging.

## Weekly Reports

At Recurse, batch members are encouraged to post text check-ins in their respective Zulip streams. Thanks to this practice, I am able to track and share my progress, as well as stay accountable to myself and learn from the obstacles blocking my workflows.

### Week 1

I decided to excuse myself from the requirement of writing any code in the first week, as it is quite an overwhelming and social week, but in retrospect I wish I had challenged myself a bit more, and at least refactored some code in the project that I applied to RC with, so that I could present it during Friday presentations. However, I did:

- work on [sunshine act](https://asyaplugged.in/do/sunshine-act/) pen and paper RPG game
- write short bios of everyone so i could remember peoples names and personalities
- experimented with check-in formatting
- make a [master channel on are.na](https://www.are.na/anastasia-davydova-lewis/recurse-center-2022) for all my RC batch related research
- attend a pairing workshop
- made ~1 new friend.

### Week 2

I became a lot more comfortable with all the RC software, so I set out to program every day. Despite such a clear intention, I only commited code on 3 of the 5 days, as I ended up feeling quite drained by the frequent "coffee chats", planning to work on other people's projects, and attending the social events.

- attended the "Building your volutional muscles" workshop, enjoyed it very much
- started learning `Go` for my TUI game, ascii tarot
- got sidetracked from learning `Go` with elektronika project bc of embedded meeing
- attended the creative coding, but failed at my task because of updated browser permissions issues in `p5.js`
- had a coffee chat with a career center staff member
- made ~6 new friends!

### Week 3

Learning Go felt a little out of left field, so I decided to spin up a "quick and dirty" static website. The theme I chose to base it off of was anything but quick to work with, however it did prove to make for some quite dirty coding work. Ultimately, I was pleased with my 4/5 daily commits, and the fact that I didn't have to poke around the Go reference documents for a short while.

- learned about `SQL`
- started working with `Zola` and the karzok theme, `npm` became the bane of my existence
- met with a staff member to discuss time management and my struggle with "doing other peoples homework" instead of focusing on my own work
- attended the "Balancing learning generously with your own work" workshop - really loved it
- attended the "feelings check-in"
- made ~4 new friends.

### Week 4

Attending the weekly intentions and reflections meetings was quite phenomenal. In general, I find intentionality incredibly meaningful and valuable in my own routine, so sharing such a practice with fellow Recursers changed my entire experience. I felt a lot closer to the community, and struggled less with accountability.

Another big change was replacing my coffee chat bot with the pairing bot. I noticed that the daily chit-chat meetings spawned by the coffee chat bot took a lot of energy out of me, but didn't translate into a sense of satisfaction with how much I was learning programming or making progress on a project, be it mine or someone elses. Switching up the bots helped a lot, as I could at the very least look at somebody else's code and ask about their goals at RC, rather than talk about our outside hobbies for an hour.

- started attending weekly intentions and reflections
- presented during career panel
- replaced coffee chat bot with pairing bot
- shipped my personal website
- paired with people on their projects, which was very rewarding.
- got some excellent pointers on Go from someonw who has worked at the Go team
- had a meeting with the career center
- made ~4 new friends.
