# Immortal UNC Slaycation: Post-Game Review

I'd like to thank each and every founding team member who joined us at **Immortal UNC Slaycation**, the one and only birthday party celebrating our immortal boy Blaine O'Neill. You showed up, you showed off your personality, and now I ask one more thing of you: please show one another the photos you took in by sharing them in this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ucbN-oxoy87O2iccLcvGIR-GqS2xRgZk?usp=sharing).

## Enlightened Moments

- **The Energy**  
  With nearly sixty guests, the sheer chaos became its own kind of magic. The room buzzed with founder pitches, alliances, and absurd rituals. The vibe leaned more *festival of ideas* than *structured game*, and that looseness worked well for fun.

- **Team Dynamics**  
  Teams like *Synergy* and *Wildcats* fully leaned into the satire. Watching people adopt archetypes (diva, tyrant, perfectionist, etc.) with improv flair created natural comedy without needing heavy mechanics.

- **Aesthetic Touches**  
  The badges, intake forms, and concierge service brought the whole thing into “mini-conference” territory. Even skeptics were won over by the immersive design details.

## Toxic Vibes

- **The Crunchy Rules**  
  Despite originally basing this event on a rule-free module I designed called "Angel Therapy" Blaine insisted that as a GAME MASTER, I must build out real RPG-style mechanics with HP, XP, modifiers, and enlightenment/toxicity tracks. In practice, this slowed the flow and confused casual players. Many guests ignored the dice system entirely and just role-played their way through.

- **Scale of Attendance**  
  My initial brief specified to design the game for 10–15 people. Upon refining the guest list, we realized that Blaine loves (and is loved by) many people, so we ended up inviting closer to **120**. At that scale, managing dice rolls, hidden saboteur mechanics, and layered stats became impossible without additional staff. Shout out to my sexy intern [Benjamin Bascom](https://www.instagram.com/mocsabnimajneb/).

- **Over-Engineering**  
  I even consulted with Odyssey Games in Pasadena on dice math and Werewolf-style saboteur roles. While cool in theory, most of that design work went unused. Players responded more to spectacle and social banter than rules-heavy complexity. I should have just hosted the party Shark Tank style, and my mind would have been free to actually be present with all you lovely guests.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Design for the Real.** If someone says “10–15,” prepare for “about a million.”  
2. **Rules-Light > Rules-Heavy for Parties.** At a birthday, guests want to play, stomp, chant, and get injected with NAD+, not study a mystery rulebook.
3. **Aesthetic Immersion Wins.** The badges, themes, and rituals mattered more than the mechanics.
4. **Better to Be Shark Tank Than D&D.** For this scale, a simple pitching/roasting format with funny awards would have been the sweet spot.
5. **Clarity = Fairness.** The random badge color assignment ended up hurting some people's feelings. While it was always possible to embody oneself as a "Diva" even with a "Peet Reviewer" badge, giving players more control over their destiny would have been kinder than just cackling "Deal with it! You're a vaccinated lib!".

## Closing Thoughts

Despite the chaos, *Immortal UNC Slaycation* delivered: guests' truest natures were exposed, the dogs perservered, pitches were made, roles were impeccably played, and I learned that sometimes the most important thing is watching how people want to play naturally. Next time, I'll just focus on cunty badges, a loudspeaker, and transdermal magnesium.
