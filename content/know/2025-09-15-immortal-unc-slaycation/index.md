# Post-Conference Report

I'd like to thank each and every founding team member who joined us at **Immortal UNC Slaycation**, the one and only birthday party celebrating our immortal boy Blaine O'Neill. You showed up, you showed off your personality, and now I ask one more thing of you: please show one another the photos you took in by sharing them in this [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ucbN-oxoy87O2iccLcvGIR-GqS2xRgZk?usp=sharing).

## Enlightened Moments

- **The Energy**  
  While I designed the game for 10-15 guests, upon refining the guest list, we realized that Blaine loves (and is loved by) very many people, so we ended up inviting closer to **120**. The sheer chaos of the crowd became its own kind of magic. The room buzzed with founder pitches, newfound frenemies, and absurd rituals.

- **Team Dynamics**  
  Teams like *Paige Wishart's Glam and Mutual Aid Fund* and *Wildcats* fully leaned into the satire. Despite the game master's sneaky antics with the random badge color assortment, people embodied their true "Diva" selves even within a "Vaccinated Liberal" assigned archetype.
  
- **Conference Implosion**  
  The DIY badges, intake forms, concierge texts and shuttle service brought the whole thing into “psychotic over-engineered tech wellness clusterfuck" territory. Every little detail ended up contributing to the goal of critiquing commodified wellness culture, from the Fry's Electronics shopping basket full of liposomal vitamin C and looney bin socks, to the RPG dice that got thrown out of the game after only two rolls.

## Closing Thoughts

Despite the chaos, *Immortal UNC Slaycation* delivered: guests' truest natures were exposed, the dogs perservered, pitches were made, roles were impeccably played, and I learned that sometimes the most important thing is watching how people want to play naturally.
