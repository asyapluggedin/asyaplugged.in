This Friday I visited Apex Electronics Surplus in Sun Valley, CA.

## So much stuff!

It was cool. I was very excited by the sheer size of the store and amount of available items, so I recorded a birthday wish for my little brother in one of the aisles. My little brother was the driving force behing my inspiration for [savefrys.com](savefrys.com/), so it only felt appropriate to record a message at an electronics surplus store.

## The Thoughts

Reminded me of Claire L. Evans' blog post [Does Future Fact Depend on Present Fiction](https://www.uncubemagazine.com/blog/12291851)
