## Sunday 28

I woke up, still in a haze, not wanting to push my head into gear and pack my bags. Disintegration Loops got replaced with techno, I stuffed my suitcase and ran to the Beta Building. Too antsy to order breakfast, I talked with Cory, Rich, (Rachel, Borya,someone new) about Pr√≥spera. We are the entertainment, said Cory. He's correct. I resisted the idea a bit, responding that perhaps we could, perhaps if anybody cared, I could contribute to this place iterating on a new society with a whole of a lot more good than was currently being planned for. We dragged my luggage to the pier & took about 15 minutes and 4 people to ensure our ferry would actually arrive. TKTKTK's drone filmed us travel to Pristine Bay.
