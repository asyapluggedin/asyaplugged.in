I've been bringing my food scale to more places with me, and it's not always easy to convince people to mind their business. In particular older women tend to project some sort of eating disorder onto my behavior, even though I am eating the exact same amount (if not more) than other women that are eating in the same situation. I realize that it's not common to see a young woman tracking her macros in a healthy manner, so I understand where the assumption (and accompanying concerns / performative sighing) is coming from, but nonetheless it's a frustrating experience to have over and over again. 

I've been enjoying using Macrofactor so much that I'm willing to deal with the potential judgement or misunderstanding from people so that I can ensure that I am tracking accurately. Being in a muscle-sparing cut means that I have to be precise about my caloric deficit, and cannot go below a 400-500 calorie deficit. Given the amount of exercise that I'm doing, and the process of my body recomposition, my infradian rhythms and all the other variables that influence my total energy expenditure, I'd rather not take neither a "set it and forget it" to my caloric goals, or an guesstimation-based approach to my nutrition tracking. 

So far I know I've lost ~6 lbs fat from the beginning of the year and stayed relatively stable wrt muscle which is a much slower rate of recomp progress than reported in my January gains post, but is a speed I'm also pleased with as it's not extreme, there hasn't been any muscle loss, and I'm able to keep up with my progressive overload training program.
