Zoom has a built-in closed captioning function that can make meetings accessible for many different people, but it requires meeting leaders to turn them on manually in the extended browser settings.


The "full transcript" setting right below "automated captions" needs to be checked in order to  have the subtitles show in a sidebar that can be viewed even a few moments after things are said. I also check "save captions" for the purpose of post-meeting minute taking / reflections.
