## Why Captions Matter
Zoom has a built-in closed captioning function that can make meetings accessible for people with hearing and learning disabilities, but it requires meeting leaders to turn them on manually in the extended browser settings.


### Step 1: Enable Captioning in Browser Settings

1. Go to your [Zoom Settings → Meeting tab](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting).  
2. Scroll all the way down to **In Meeting (Advanced)**.  
3. Toggle **Closed Captioning**, and **Save Captions** to **ON**.  
4. Make sure both **Allow use of Caption API** and **Enable Live Transcription** are checked — this allows subtitles to appear in a sidebar that remains visible after something is said.  
5. Enabling **Save Captions** is useful for post-meeting note-taking. If it is not enabled, meeting participants can still take screenshots of the sidebar, so it's a kind gesture to toggle it on.

### Step 2: Turn On Captions During a Meeting

1. Once your meeting starts, click the **CC** icon in the meeting control bar.  
2. Select **Enable Auto-Transcription**.  
This will activate both live closed captions and a transcript sidebar. You can also save the transcript automatically if the meeting is recorded.

Congratulations, you're done. Now your meeting is accessible!
