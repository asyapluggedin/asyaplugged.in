This Friday marks the mid-point of my batch at the Recurse Center. I am in a 12 week batch, meaning I have completed 30 out of 60 days of the programming retreat. I already feel like a different person and a better programmer than when I started, and figured that it could be helpful for others to hear about my experience.

Because I intended to do a 12 week retreat from the very start, I will say that I was a little lax with planning my time to be at maximum efficiency. My main goal for the retreat was proving to myself that I enjoy regular programming and learning new things, even if they look very much strange, and feel very much challenging.

## Weekly Reports

At Recurse, batch members are encouraged to post text check-ins in their respective Zulip streams. Thanks to this practice, I am able to track and share my progress, as well as stay accountable to myself and learn from the obstacles blocking my workflows.
### Week 1

I decided to excuse myself from the requirement of writing any code in the first week, as it is quite an overwhelming and social week, but in retrospect I wish I had challenged myself a bit more, and at least refactored some code in the project that I applied to RC with, so that I could present it during Friday presentations. However, I did:

- work on [sunshine act]
wrote short bios of everyone so i could remember peoples names
experimented with check-in formatting
rc application
are.na rc page
pairing workshop

### Week 2

building volutional muscles
got sidetracked with elektronika project bc of embedded meeing
made friends
ascii tarot

career center meeting

### Week 3

met with a staff member to discuss time management and my struggle with "doing other peoples homework" rather than focusing on my own work
balancing learning generously with your own work - really loved this workshop

### Week 4
