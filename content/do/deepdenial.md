I was invited to the Hackers and Designers Summer Academy (a program run out of the Sandberg Institute, the postgraduate programme of the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam) to teach a one-day creative coding workshop.

_DeepDenial_ is a ML art workshop designed for students of varied technical or non-technical backgrounds. Attendees learned how to extract and organize data in order to apply a neural network for the purpose of making "deepfakes", or videos with swapped faces.
