# Curating
In November 2015, I curated a group exhibition featuring ten international artists. I scouted the artists from social media, spanning all different platforms, from Yelp to Last.fm, from OkCupid to Tumblr. Instead of making my curatorial selection based on reputation or portfolio, I tried to choose people without (much) prior experience exhibiting their work, relying on my online aesthetic intution. 

In order to accuratelv execute my curatorial vision, I had to take
complete control of the exhibition design and even temporarily re-brand the gallery. This included painting the whole space by
hand and designing the press relcase to communicate an carnest, vet malformed attempt at a luxury art show.
Through this experience the work of the artists who did not have prior experience exhibiting their work was snapped and thrown back onto on social media: but now, with a filter of legitimacy.
