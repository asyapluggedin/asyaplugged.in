The Tarot has always been practiced IRL - only through the tactile motions of shuffling, through the candlelight flickers that ignite our anticipation, through our belief that the material will translate something from the corporeal - are we able to find out fate, and believe the narrative that is drawn.

With the excitement of the world wide web, the late 1990's and early 2000's filled the internet with starry backgrounds and animations of divinatory motifs. 8-ball websites were generated, and early web surfers asked the god in the machine what their fate would become. Of course, the programmatic algorithm never could connect to the corporeal quite the same way, acting in a way more reminiscent of a predictably written fortune cookie (stupid american invention, by the way).

I created a full deck of tarot cards using ASCII art in an attempt to connect the innocence we had way back when on the web, with the physical ability to tell our fortunes. Perhaps it's a relic, perhaps it's a glimpse into the future...
